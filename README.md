# Part 1: Basic Parallel Coordinates

Basic renderer which loads the data and displays it as needed. It labels everything: titles, tick marks, ranges, etc. 
It supports the following basic tasks:

  1.Filtering the data across multiple attributes,
  2.Reordering the axes, and
  3.Inverting the axes.
  
 the result looks like this:

The Program doesn’t require any external libraries or knowledge to run. Upon running the program the user is requested to choose the file to read and show in a parallel coordinates system. The user then can reorder the axis using the top button or the user can flip the axis using the bottom button. Moreover the user with can filter attributes and display some attributes. The user can do so by simply moving the red bar that surrounds the axis. 


Draft.jpg, my draft/initial idea of the tool

The first thing that I did in order to came up with this visualization is looking other examples of this type of visualization and try to come up something that I was able to do it in the two weeks period. The first thing that I want to include was some sort of flipping the axis. In my mind I had a more complex way to it, but at the end I found the button easier to understand and to re-order the axis. My initial thought was more like dragging the axis in the right position to move it. However, I found it more complicated to import it and not as direct as button for the user to understand. The user can just click on button while by dragging the axis the user actually needs to know that feature otherwise it will take some time to figure out. After by looking online I tried to find the best way to filter the data. At first I was thinking, draw a rectangle between the data but then a realize that the user can actually use a rectangle  that surrounds the axis in order to achieve filtering. I really like this feature because the user can simple dragging up and down the bar to his liking to achieve what he wants to achieve. At the end  I decided a way to flip the axis. In the case I didn’t have any doubt a button will fit nicely. In fact, this is what I did. A simple button that can flip the axis. I tried to make it as simple as possible for the user to interact.
